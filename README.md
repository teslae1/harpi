# Harpi 
Harpi is a cli tool that executes *.harpi.yml files which are simple text based http request scripts.
The file format of the *.harpi.yml files support sending http requests and asserting response data. 
Example:
```yml
variables:
  baseAddress: "https://test.com"
  itemId: "1" 
  itemTitle: "item 1"

requests:
  - name: "create data"
    method: "post"
    url: "$(baseAddress)/api/data/$(itemId)"
    jsonBody: 
      title: "$(itemTitle)"

  - name: "verify data now available"
    method: "get"
    url: "$(baseAddress)/api/data/$(itemId)"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
      javascriptAsserts:
        - name: "has expected title" 
          code: "response.title == '$(itemTitle)'"
```
The file can then be executed by using the "run" command
```
harpi run mytestfile.harpi.yml
```
## Installing 
```
npm install harpi_cli -g
```
## Example
Download the example script to your current directory
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teslae1/harpi/main/example.harpi.yml
```
List the requests of the script
```
harpi ls example.harpi.yml
```
Run the script 
```
harpi run example.harpi.yml 
```
## Saving and using response data
It is possible to assign response data to a variable for later use:
```yml
variables:
  myResponseValue: #Assigned by first request
  baseAddress: "https://test.com"

requests:
  - name: "create data with auto generated id"
    method: "post"
    url: "$(baseAddress)/api/data"
    javascriptAssignments:
      - name: "save id of created item"
        code: "setSessionVariable('myResponseValue', response.id)"

  - name: "verify data now available at id"
    method: "get"
    url: "$(baseAddress)/api/data/$(myResponseValue)"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
```
## Executing an individual request
It is possible to execute a single request - using the "ls" command all the http requests are listed with an id:

```
$> harpi ls myfile.harpi.yml
$> - request
$>   - id: 1
$>   - url: $(baseAddress)/api/data
$>   - method: post
$> - request
$>   - id: 2
$>   - url: $(baseAddress)/api/data/$(myResponseValue)
$>   - method: get
```

It is then possible to only execute request 2:
```
$> harpi run myfile.harpi.yml 2
```
## Taking values as parameters
It is possible to take parameters from the command line - which then will be assigned to a variable. 
This is achieved by using the "required" keyword:

```yml
variables:
  token: required 
  apiKey: required

headers:
  Authorization: "Bearer $(token)"
  ApiKey: "$(apiKey)"

requests:
  - name: "verify data now available at id"
    method: "get"
    url: "https://test.com/api/data/2"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
```

This will now make it required to provide the defined variables when running the file:

```
$> harpi run myfile.harpi.yml --variables token=MYTOKEN,apiKey=MYAPIKEY
```

## Headers
Example of setting headers for all requests
```yml
variables:
  token: required 
  apiKey: required

headers:
  Authorization: "Bearer $(token)"
  ApiKey: "$(apiKey)"

requests:
  - name: "This request will have both the headers defined in header"
    method: "get"
    url: "https://test.com/api/data/2"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
  - name: "This request will also have both the headers defined in header"
    method: "get"
    url: "https://test.com/api/data/2"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
```

## Waiting between requests
It is possible to insert a wait between two requests:
```yml
variables:
  myResponseValue: #Assigned by first request
  baseAddress: "https://test.com"

requests:
  - name: "create data with auto generated id"
    method: "post"
    url: "https://test.com/api/data/1"
    #Waiting 500 milliseconds before executing next request
    waitBeforeNextRequest:
      name: "Waiting for data to be prepared"
      milliseconds: 500

  - name: "verify data now available at id"
    method: "get"
    url: "https://test.com/api/data/1"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
```

## Auto generated values
It is possible to auto generate values like guids and dates. 
The values will be regenerated whenever the first request is executed
```yml
variables:
  currentDate: $(date)
  dateFiveMinutesInFuture: $(date.addMinutes(5))
  autoGeneratedId: $(guid)
  
requests:
  - url: "https://test.com/api/data/$(autoGeneratedId)"
    method: "post"
    jsonBody:
      someDateProperty: "$(currentDate)"
      anotherDateProperty: "$(dateFiveMinutesInFuture)"
```

## all supported types of asserts
Harpi supports a set of asserts and also supports you definning custom asserts in javascript.
```yml
variables:
  baseAddress: "https://test.com"

requests:
  - name: "assert on response"
    method: "get"
    url: "$(baseAddress)/api/data/1"
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
      responseContains: "testTitle"
      javascriptAssert:
        - name: "assert first element has expected title"
          code: "response[0].title == 'testTitle'"

```

## Using harpi as api content response comparison
Harpi is intended to work with simple datatypes for dynamically assigned values and comparisons
but does in some ways support comparing entire api responses by converting the responses 
into simple datatypes and then comparing them. An example using base64 format to compare 
an api's response exactly matches that of another:
```yml
variables:
  api1Url: "https://api1.com"
  api2Url: "https://api2.com"
  
requests:
  - url: "$(api1Url)/search?query=123"
    method: get
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
    javascriptAssignments:
      - code: "setSessionVariable('response', btoa(JSON.stringify(response)))"
        name: "saving first response as base64"

  - url: "$(api2Url)/search?query=123"
    method: get
    asserts:
      statusCodeEquals: 200
      javascriptAsserts:
        - code: "btoa(JSON.stringify(response)) == '$(response)'"
          name: "responses are exactly the same"
```
